Since then Google have sponsored its expansion and now the prizes of the competitions and the amount of public datasets are bigger than ever. Most competitions on Kaggle have a dataset, an accuracy metric and a leaderboard to compare submissions.\n",

    "The dataset consists approximately 1,584 images of leaf specimens (16 samples each of 99 species) which have been converted to binary black leaves against white backgrounds. Three sets of features are also provided per image: a shape contiguous descriptor, an interior texture histogram, and a Ô¨Åne-scale margin histogram. For each feature, a 64-attribute vector is given per leaf sample.\n",
